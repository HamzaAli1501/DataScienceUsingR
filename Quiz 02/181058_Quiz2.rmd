# Question 1

Do data(mtcars) from the datasets package and fit the regression model with mpg as
the outcome and weight as the predictor. Give the slope coefficient.

> Importing Data mtcars
```{r}
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)

```

Now we need mpg as y_outcome, and weight as x_predict
```{r}
y_outcome <- mtcars$mpg
x_pred <- mtcars$wt

#Linear Model
model <-  lm(y_outcome ~ x_pred, data = mtcars)
summary(model)
coef(model)
```

# Question 02

Consider the following data set (used above as well). What is the intercept for fitting the
model with x as the predictor and y as the outcome?

> Inputing values

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

x <- c(0.8, 0.47, 0.51, 0.73, 0.36, 0.58, 0.57, 0.85, 0.44, 0.42)
y <- c(1.39, 0.72, 1.55, 0.48, 1.19, -1.59, 1.23, -0.65, 1.49, 0.05)

# Creating a linear model
r_model <- lm(y ~ x)
r_model

```
